# Chart + Graph Guidelines Research (Official Sources)

Date: 2026-01-19

## Question
What official guidance should inform chart and graph design for the HMI presenter?

## Findings (verified)
- IBM Design Language notes that chart titles should reflect the main insight, legends should define the association of visual properties to data, and labels should be used directly on charts when possible; axes, ticks, and grid lines should clarify proportions/scale and avoid too many elements. (IBM Design Language)
- IBM Design Language emphasizes that color should be used with intent, create contrast to focus attention, and that categorical palettes suit unrelated categories while sequential palettes show relationships; color meaning should be reinforced with shapes, lines, or patterns. (IBM Design Language)
- Microsoft Support notes that chart elements such as titles and data labels can be added to improve clarity. (Microsoft Support)
- Hennepin County’s design system advises chart text to be no smaller than 16px, requires short and long text descriptions (alt text), and recommends providing data in tables or downloadable Excel/CSV files. (Hennepin County Design System)
- WCAG guidance requires at least 4.5:1 contrast for normal text (3:1 for large text) and at least 3:1 contrast for non-text UI components and meaningful graphical objects. (W3C)
