# HMI Header/Menu/Rail Standards Research (2026-01-18)

## Question
What official guidance (ISA‑101 / ISO 11064) applies to control‑room/HMI layout decisions relevant to header/menu height, screen utilization, and operator usability?

## Verified facts (official sources)
- ISA‑101 is the ISA standards series covering Human‑Machine Interfaces; ISA lists ANSI/ISA‑101.01‑2015 as the HMI standard for process automation systems and positions it as a lifecycle‑based framework for HMI design and management. 
- ISA publishes supporting technical reports including ISA‑TR101.01 (HMI Philosophy) and ISA‑TR101.02 (HMI Usability and Performance) that expand on implementation guidance.
- ISO 11064 is a multi‑part standard for ergonomic design of control centres. ISO 11064‑4:2013 addresses layout and dimensions of control workstations (visual display workstations) and remains current as of its 2024 confirmation.
- ISO 11064‑1:2000 provides general principles for control centre design and remains current per ISO confirmation.
- ISO 11064‑7:2006 provides principles for evaluation of control centres and remains current per ISO confirmation.
- ISO 11064‑6:2005 addresses environmental requirements for control centres (lighting, acoustics, thermal, etc.) and remains current per ISO confirmation.

## Implications for HMI presenter (local inference)
- Use ISA‑101 lifecycle + philosophy guidance to justify a compact, consistent header/menu design and a dedicated HMI philosophy document for console layout decisions.
- Use ISO 11064 workstation layout principles to justify maximizing usable display area, minimizing unused bands, and ensuring rail/panel layout supports operator reach and visual scanning.
- For precise numeric dimensions, the ISO standards are paywalled; only abstracts were accessible.

## Gaps
- Numeric workstation dimension requirements from ISO 11064‑4 are not available in the public abstract.
- Full ISA‑101.01 and ISA‑TR101.02 details are paywalled; exact clauses for display zone allocations are not available.
